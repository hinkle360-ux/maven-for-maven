# Maven Core Requirements
# =======================
#
# These are the requirements for the Maven core brain system.
# The core is designed to be stdlib-only, so this file should
# ideally be empty or contain only optional development tools.
#
# Core brains do NOT require any external packages.
# All external I/O is delegated to host_tools.

# No external dependencies required for core brains.
# The core uses only Python 3.11+ stdlib.
